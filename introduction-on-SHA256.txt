------------------------------------------------------
SHA256 is a hashing algorithm.
Takes some string and it turns it into some fixed length binary string (digest).
Purpose: if we change the message just slightly, the digest becomes totally different.
However, it is theoretically possible (but very very unlikely) that a so called "hash collision" happens, meaning that two different strings produce the same digest. The longer the digest, the less likely hash collision is.
Hashing algorithms are also used to encrypt passwords, so that are not stored in clear format and this techniques has its own flaws (but this is off-topic for this project).
